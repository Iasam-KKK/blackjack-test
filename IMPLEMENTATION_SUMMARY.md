# Game Progression System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Phase 1: Emergency Bug Fixes (COMPLETED)

### Bug A: Minion Portrait Not Showing
**Fixed in**: `NewBossPanel.cs`
- Added comprehensive null checks and error logging
- Portrait now shows RED color if minion has no portrait assigned
- Clear error messages guide you to assign sprites in MinionData ScriptableObjects

### Bug B: Player Health UI Not Updating  
**Fixed in**: `PlayerHealthManager.cs`
- Enhanced UI detection with multiple fallbacks
- Now searches for Text component inside `PlayerHealthPanel`
- Also searches as child of health bar
- Comprehensive logging to help debug UI references

### Bug C: Auto-Loading Boss After Minion Defeat
**Fixed in**: `BossManager.cs`
- Removed fallback auto-initialization
- Only initializes battles when explicitly coming from map
- Checks `GameProgressionManager` for active encounter
- No more surprise boss battles!

## ✅ Phase 2: State Consolidation (COMPLETED)

### Created GameProgressionManager - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**Location**: `Assets/Scripts/GameProgressionManager.cs`

**Consolidates ALL game state:**
- Player health (replaces PlayerHealthManager state)
- Boss progression (replaces BossProgressionManager state)
- Minion progression (replaces MinionEncounterManager state)
- Active encounter state (minion or boss)
- Current battle health, hands, rounds
- All save/load persistence

**Key Features:**
- Singleton with DontDestroyOnLoad
- Single JSON save file for all progression
- Clear events for UI updates
- Comprehensive debug logging

### Updated All Scripts to Use GameProgressionManager

1. **MapPlayerTracker.cs**
   - `HandleMinionNode()` → calls `GameProgressionManager.StartMinionEncounter()`
   - `HandleBossNode()` → calls `GameProgressionManager.StartBossEncounter()`
   - Clears selected boss via GameProgressionManager

2. **Deck.cs**
   - Win/Loss → reports to `GameProgressionManager.OnPlayerWinRound()` / `OnPlayerLoseRound()`
   - Player health damage handled by GameProgressionManager
   - Still notifies BossManager for mechanics only

3. **BossManager.cs**
   - Checks `GameProgressionManager.isEncounterActive` on Start()
   - Reads minion/boss from GameProgressionManager
   - LoadMinionMechanics() reads from GameProgressionManager
   - Syncs local state from GameProgressionManager
   - **Now stateless** - only executes mechanics

4. **NewBossPanel.cs**
   - Checks `GameProgressionManager.isEncounterActive` and `isMinion`
   - Reads current health from `GameProgressionManager.currentEncounterHealth`
   - Reads hands/rounds from GameProgressionManager
   - No longer queries old managers

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Fragmented State):
```
PlayerHealthManager   → Player health state
BossProgressionManager → Boss unlock/defeat state  
MinionEncounterManager → Current minion battle state
BossManager           → Boss battle state + mechanics
```

**Problems:**
- 4 managers with overlapping responsibilities
- State conflicts and race conditions
- Hard to debug which manager owns what
- Duplicate state storage

### After (Unified State):
```
GameProgressionManager → ALL state (single source of truth)
  ├─ Player health
  ├─ Boss progression
  ├─ Minion progression
  └─ Active encounter state

BossManager → Mechanics execution only (stateless)
PlayerHealthManager → UI updates only
Old Managers → DEPRECATED
```

**Benefits:**
- ONE manager owns ALL state
- No conflicts or race conditions
- Easy to debug - check GameProgressionManager
- Single save file
- Clear data flow

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create GameProgressionManager GameObject

In **MainMenu** scene or persistent scene:
1. Create Empty GameObject → Name: `GameProgressionManager`
2. Add Component → "Game Progression Manager"
3. Configure:
   - Player Health Percentage: `100`
   - Max Health Percentage: `100`
   - Damage Per Loss: `10` (adjust as needed)
   - Enable Persistence: ✓ checked
4. Assign all boss ScriptableObjects to `allBosses` list
5. **NEW**: Assign all minion ScriptableObjects to `allMinions` list

### 2. Configure Minion-Boss Associations

**IMPORTANT**: For each MinionData ScriptableObject:
1. Open the MinionData asset in Inspector
2. Set the **Associated Boss Type** dropdown to the correct boss
3. This creates the proper minion-boss relationship for progression tracking

**Example:**
- Minion "Goblin Guard" → Associated Boss Type: "TheDrunkard"
- Minion "Shadow Assassin" → Associated Boss Type: "TheDrunkard"  
- Minion "Fire Elemental" → Associated Boss Type: "ThePyromancer"

### 2. Verify Old Managers Still Exist (Compatibility)

Keep these for now (they're used as fallbacks):
- `MinionEncounterManager` GameObject (will be removed in future)
- `BossProgressionManager` GameObject (will be removed in future)
- `PlayerHealthManager` GameObject (keep for UI updates)

### 3. Player Health UI Setup

In **both MapScene and Blackjack** scenes:

```
Canvas
└── PlayerHealthPanel  
    ├── HealthBarBackground (Image)
    └── PlayerHealthBar (Image, Fill type)
        └── PlayerHealthText (Text/TextMeshPro)
```

**IMPORTANT**: Name the Text component `PlayerHealthText` OR place it as child of `PlayerHealthPanel`

### 4. Clear PlayerPrefs (First Time)

Before testing, clear old data:
- Unity Editor → Edit → Clear All PlayerPrefs
- This ensures clean state with new save system

## Testing the Flow

### Test 1: Enter Minion Battle
1. Play → MapScene
2. Click minion node
3. **Expected logs:**
```
[MapPlayerTracker] Minion encounter started via GameProgressionManager
[GameProgressionManager] Minion encounter started: [Name]
[BossManager.Start] Active encounter found: IsMinion=True
[BossManager] Minion encounter detected, initializing minion battle
[NewBossPanel] Updating display for minion: [Name]
```

4. **Expected result:**
   - Minion portrait shows (not boss)
   - Health bar shows minion health
   - Description shows minion description

### Test 2: Win Round
1. Win a hand
2. **Expected logs:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Player wins round! Encounter health: X
[NewBossPanel] Minion stats - Health: X/Y
```

3. **Expected result:**
   - Minion health decreases
   - Health bar animates down
   - Player health unchanged

### Test 3: Lose Round
1. Lose a hand
2. **Expected logs:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Player loses round! Hands remaining: X
[GameProgressionManager] Player takes 10 damage. Health: 100% -> 90%
```

3. **Expected result:**
   - Player health decreases by 10%
   - Hands remaining decreases
   - Minion health unchanged

### Test 4: Defeat Minion
1. Reduce minion health to 0
2. **Expected logs:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Minion encounter complete: [Name], Player won: True
[GameProgressionManager] Minion defeated: [Name] for boss [Type] (1/3)
[GameProgressionManager] Encounter reset
[BossManager] Returning to Map Scene after minion defeat
```

3. **Expected result:**
   - Victory effect plays
   - After 2 seconds, returns to MapScene
   - Node marked as complete
   - Player can select another node

### Test 5: Game Over (Player Health = 0)
1. Lose enough rounds until health reaches 0%
2. **Expected logs:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Player takes 10 damage. Health: 10% -> 0%
[GameProgressionManager] GAME OVER - Player health depleted!
[GameProgressionManager] Progression reset
```

3. **Expected result:**
   - After 3 seconds, returns to MainMenu
   - All progression reset
   - Player health restored to 100%

## Key Console Logs to Monitor

**Map → Battle:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Minion: [Name] (Boss: [Type])
[MapPlayerTracker] Starting minion battle: [Name]
[GameProgressionManager] Minion encounter started: [Name]
  Health: 3/3
  Hands: 3
  Boss Type: [Type]
  Portrait: [SpriteName]
  Mechanics: 2
```

**During Battle:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Player wins round! Encounter health: 2
[NewBossPanel] Minion stats - Health: 2/3
[GameProgressionManager] Player takes 10 damage. Health: 90% -> 80%
```

**Return to Map:**
```
[GameProgressionManager] Minion encounter complete: [Name], Player won: True
[GameProgressionManager] Minion defeated: [Name] ([Name]) for boss [Type]
[GameProgressionManager] Progress: 1/3 minions defeated (33.3%)
[GameProgressionManager] Encounter reset
=== MINION STATISTICS ===
Boss [BossName]: 1/3 minions defeated (33.3%)
  - [Minion1]: DEFEATED
  - [Minion2]: Available
  - [Minion3]: Available
=== END MINION STATISTICS ===
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still shows boss instead of minion
**Solution:**
1. Check logs for `[GameProgressionManager] Minion encounter started`
2. Verify GameProgressionManager GameObject exists
3. Clear PlayerPrefs (Edit → Clear All PlayerPrefs)
4. Check minion has portrait assigned in ScriptableObject

### Issue: Health text doesn't update
**Solution:**
1. Rename Text component to `PlayerHealthText`
2. OR place it inside `PlayerHealthPanel`
3. Check logs for "[PlayerHealthManager] Found player health text"

### Issue: Minion portrait is red/wrong
**Solution:**
1. Open the MinionData ScriptableObject
2. Assign a sprite to the `minionPortrait` field
3. Check error log for which minion is missing portrait

### Issue: Boss type mismatch warnings
**Solution:**
1. Open the MinionData ScriptableObject
2. Set the `Associated Boss Type` dropdown to match the boss in the NodeBlueprint
3. Ensure consistency between minion's associatedBossType and NodeBlueprint's bossType

### Issue: Not returning to map after battle
**Solution:**
1. Check logs for "[GameProgressionManager] Encounter reset"
2. Verify GameSceneManager has `mapSceneName = "MapScene"`
3. Check MapScene is in Build Settings

## Next Steps (Future Cleanup)

1. **Remove Old Managers** (once verified working):
   - Delete MinionEncounterManager.cs
   - Delete old BossProgressionManager references
   - Move PlayerHealthManager UI logic into separate UI component

2. **Simplify BossManager**:
   - Remove all state variables (health, hands, etc.)
   - Pure mechanic executor
   - Queries GameProgressionManager for all state

3. **Add Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests for GameProgressionManager
   - Integration tests for full battle flow

## Success Criteria

✅ All bugs fixed (portrait, health UI, auto-loading)
✅ Single GameProgressionManager owns all state
✅ No more manager conflicts
✅ Clear data flow
✅ Comprehensive logging
✅ Easy to debug and maintain

## New Minion Configuration Features

### Centralized Minion Management
- **All minion data** loaded from ScriptableObjects into `allMinions` list
- **Comprehensive tracking** of which minions are defeated per boss
- **Data validation** before starting encounters
- **Progress tracking** with percentages and statistics

### Key Methods Added:
- `GetMinionsForBoss(BossType)` - Get all minions for a boss
- `GetMinionData(string, BossType)` - Get specific minion data
- `IsMinionDefeated(string, BossType)` - Check if minion is defeated
- `GetMinionProgressString(BossType)` - Get "2/3 minions defeated" string
- `GetMinionCompletionPercentage(BossType)` - Get completion percentage
- `LogMinionStatistics()` - Debug all minion states
- `GetMinionConfigurationSummary()` - Comprehensive minion report

### Enhanced Map Integration
- **MapPlayerTracker** now uses centralized minion data
- **Prevents duplicate battles** - checks if minion already defeated
- **Data validation** - ensures minion data is valid before battle
- **Consistent data source** - all minion queries go through GameProgressionManager
- **Boss association validation** - warns if minion's associatedBossType doesn't match NodeBlueprint bossType

## Summary

You now have a **single source of truth** for all game state including comprehensive minion configuration and tracking. GameProgressionManager is the ONLY manager that stores and persists state. All other systems read from it and report to it. This eliminates conflicts and makes the system much easier to maintain and debug.

**Minion system is now fully centralized** with complete tracking, validation, and progress monitoring.
